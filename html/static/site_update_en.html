The most significant are: 1) the pedigree/family tree drawing now scales to fit on a single page; 2) the text table is now combined with the pedigree output so you have everything you need in one file; 3) the pedigree now shows abbreviations for additional diseases you add; 4) a change in the initial workflow and other tweaks to reduce the chance of someone accidentally losing their data. Several visual and text enhancements were also made to keep our tool as user-friendly as possible, as well as even better error handling in the event of a problem.</td>

        <td>A redesigned website is launched with a bold new look-and-feel, along with several functional enhancements. Those enhancements include a new way to track diseases throughout your entire family. This change cuts down on the amount of data entry, and is a direct result of user feedback submitted through the site (users can still add unique diseases or conditions to each family member individually). Another change is the ability to graphically preview the family tree centered upon a different family member. This preview feature allows someone to carry through all the data previously entered for family members rather than starting over for that new member. In addition to the technical changes, several new family health history projects focus on Alaska Native and Appalachian Communities (http://www.genome.gov/19518941).</td>
