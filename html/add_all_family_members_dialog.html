<p class='instructions'>Now we will build your family. Tell us about your immediate family, including your brothers, sisters, 
children, aunts, and uncles. You can add more family members like cousins, nieces, nephews, half siblings, 
and grandchildren later. We automatically add your parents and grandparents for you. (We collect information 
only for blood relatives, not household members, step-relatives, or spouses not related by blood.)
