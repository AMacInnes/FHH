<P>You are at an <B><U>increased risk</U></B> for having type 2 diabetes. No tool for assessing risk is perfect 
and only your health care provider can tell for sure if you do have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (a condition 
that precedes type 2 diabetes in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal). <U>Talk to your health care 
provider to see if additional testing is needed.</U></P>

<P>Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. 
People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. This form of diabetes usually begins with 
insulin resistance, a condition in which fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin properly. At first, the 
pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. In time, however, it loses the ability to 
secrete enough insulin in response to meals. People who are overweight and inactive are more likely to develop 
type 2 diabetes. Treatment includes taking diabetes medicines, making wise food choices, exercising regularly, 
controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and, for some, taking aspirin daily.</P>

<P>For more information on type 2 diabetes please visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Disease's National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse at:</P?
